Not a DSLR,\n              but not a cheap camera either. I was on a work and travel program\n              in the United States, so I had time to test it and felt in love\n              with photography. This is an area in witch you find the limits of\n              your equipment very fast, and need to get a little higher. So\n              after a while I got my first DSLR. But the need for money to buy\n              lenses increased, so I decided to shoot events to finance my\n              hobby. Not a lot of my friends have this hobbie, so I can practice\n              shooting them and their families.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"hobbies-photos-container\">\n            <img src={foto01} alt=\"foto01\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={foto02} alt=\"foto02\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={foto03} alt=\"foto03\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={foto04} alt=\"foto04\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={foto05} alt=\"foto05\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hobbies-row\">\n          <div className=\"hobbies-photos-container\">\n            <img src={dance01} alt=\"dance01\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={dance04} alt=\"dance04\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={dance06} alt=\"dance06\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={dance07} alt=\"dance07\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"hobbies-text\">\n            <p className=\"hobbies-subtitle\">DANCE</p>\n            <p>\n              Do you rememver the time you were in the first grade and wanted to\n              look cool in front of your classmates? I do! All of the cool kids\n              went to this place where you could do extraculicular activities\n              after school. I went also because, off course, all the cool kids\n              went. I stopped at the dance room. At that time it was a\n              folclorique dance curriculum, a lot of children were there, a good\n              chance for me to make new friends and to get over my shiness. And\n              I still do that to this day. Travelling the world and meating new\n              people.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hobbies-row\">\n          <div className=\"hobbies-text\">\n            <p className=\"hobbies-subtitle\">DOWN-HILL</p>\n            <p>\n              The advantages of living in a small city between hills, is that\n              you have access to those hills relatively easy. I had a city bike\n              when I was a kid, used it to just go arround the city and go to my\n              granparents. But when I first went on a hill and got down from\n              there on my bike, I was hooked. Goy lucky enough to get a city\n              mountain bike, and the little engineer inside me surfaced and\n              prepared the mountain bike for down-hill. I still do that that\n              till this day, but with a more suitable bike and on hills that\n              have down-hill tracks.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"hobbies-photos-container\">\n            <img src={mtb01} alt=\"mtb01\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={mtb02} alt=\"mtb02\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={mtb03} alt=\"mtb03\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={mtb05} alt=\"mtb05\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hobbies-row\">\n          <div className=\"hobbies-photos-container\">\n            <img src={snow01} alt=\"snow01\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={snow02} alt=\"snow02\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={snow03} alt=\"snow03\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"hobbies-text\">\n            <p className=\"hobbies-subtitle\">SNOW-BOARDING</p>\n            <p>\n              With the need for adrenaline from down-hill, in the winter I had\n              do to something also. So I tried some winter sports, startes with\n              skying, but it was not for me. Long story short, got a friend to\n              borrow me snow-board, didn't even had boots, and went down a small\n              hill. I was hooked :D. Since then, I got better and better, and\n              started to roam my country in the winter time, to the slopes,\n              trying to go in a different city each year.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

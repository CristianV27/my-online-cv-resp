But when I first went on a hill and got down from\n              there on my bike, I was hooked. Goy lucky enough to get a city\n              mountain bike, and the little engineer inside me surfaced and\n              prepared the mountain bike for down-hill. I still do that that\n              till this day, but with a more suitable bike and on hills that\n              have down-hill tracks.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"hobbies-photos-container\">\n            <img src={mtb01} alt=\"mtb01\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={mtb02} alt=\"mtb02\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={mtb03} alt=\"mtb03\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={mtb05} alt=\"mtb05\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"hobbies-row\">\n          <div className=\"hobbies-photos-container\">\n            <img src={snow01} alt=\"snow01\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={snow02} alt=\"snow02\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n            <img src={snow03} alt=\"snow03\" className=\"hobbies-photo\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"hobbies-text\">\n            <p className=\"hobbies-subtitle\">SNOW-BOARDING</p>\n            <p>\n              With the need for adrenaline from down-hill, in the winter I had\n              do to something also. So I tried some winter sports, startes with\n              skying, but it was not for me. Long story short, got a friend to\n              borrow me snow-board, didn't even had boots, and went down a small\n              hill. I was hooked :D. Since then, I got better and better, and\n              started to roam my country in the winter time, to the slopes,\n              trying to go in a different city each year.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
